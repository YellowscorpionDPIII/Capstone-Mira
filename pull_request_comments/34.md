### Requested Changes/Comments (2025-12-11 14:10:07)

1. **Feature Flag Coverage**:
   - In `mira/tools/testing_harness.py`, the `MIRA_RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=false` scenario has been validated, but please include explicit maintenance mode test scenarios as referenced in the prompt.

2. **Alert Specificity**:
   - In `monitoring/alerts.yml`, while an alert for authentication failures (auth >5%) is addressed, we recommend adding one for Airtable sync error rates to align with the importance of Notion/Airtable workflows.

3. **Documentation**:
   - In `docs/SECURITY_AND_OBSERVABILITY.md`, could you elaborate on the Grafana JSON export process and the integration specifics for StatsD prefix `mira`? Refining these sections could enhance clarity for extending monitoring setups.
